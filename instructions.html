      <p>Wavelength is a social guessing game where two teams compete to read each other's minds.</p>
      <p>Teams take turns rotating a dial to where they think a hidden bullseye is located on a spectrum.</p> 
      <p>One of the players on your team — the Psychic — knows exactly where the bullseye is, and draws a card with a pair of binaries on it (such as: Job - Career, Rough - Smooth, Fantasy - Sci-Fi, Sad Song - Happy Song, etc).</p> 
      <p>The Psychic must then provide a clue that is conceptually where the bullseye is located between those two binaries.</p>
      <p>For example, if the card this round is HOT-COLD and the bullseye is slightly to the "cold" side of the centre, the Psychic needs to give a clue somewhere in that region. Perhaps "salad"?</p>
      <p>After the Psychic gives their clue, their team discusses where they think the bullseye is located and turns the dial to that location on that spectrum.</p> 
      <p>The closer to the center of the bullseye the team guess, the more points they score!</p>
